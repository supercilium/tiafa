Make sure you can run `code --help` from the command line and you get help.

1. if you do not see help, please follow these steps:

* Mac: Select Shell Command: Install 'Code' command in path from the Command Palette.
Command Palette is what pops up when you press ``shift + âŒ˜ + P`` while inside VS Code. (`shift + ctrl + P in Windows`)

* Windows: Make sure you selected Add to PATH during the installation.

* Linux: Make sure you installed Code via our new .deb or .rpm packages.

2. From the command line, run `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
